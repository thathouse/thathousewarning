        <h1>Buyer Beware</h1>
        
        <div class="intro">
            <p>If you are looking to buy the house at <strong>5480 W Iowa Ave in Lakewood, CO</strong>, you should know the sellers did not properly disclose many issues of which they were aware. Do not simply trust what the seller realtor tells you. The sellers disclosed no issues on the disclosure form. It's a cute house, but you need to know what you are getting into. Get a good inspection!</p>
        </div>

        <p class="date-note">All the information below was accurate as of November 7, 2025.</p>

        <h2>Concerns with Lack of Disclosure of Known Issues</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The seller failed to disclose that a <strong>tree fell on the corner of the house</strong> in August 2024. A structural engineer was called to examine the damage and recommend how to fix it. When the listing says "mostly new roof", that is why it's mostly new. It was around this time that the siding was replaced with cement board, so it's unclear if there is any unresolved damage underneath the exterior. This was found by looking through city permit info and was never mentioned by the seller. They disclosed no issues on the disclosure form, despite it asking if they are aware if there was EVER damage to the roof.</li>
            
            <li>The living room area and garage were added onto the house by the seller. In <strong>May 2020</strong>, a framing inspection occurred, and the house <strong>failed</strong> with the following notes: "Strap stud packs, foam plates, add anchor bolts, must verify garage/house wall attach. to fdn". The framing passed inspection in <strong>July 2021</strong>. The insulation barrier and drywall inspections were passed in <strong>November 2021</strong>. The final building inspection was originally scheduled for <strong>March 2022</strong>, but it was cancelled with a note that says "must pass final electrical and mechanical first". A permit extension was granted in <strong>October 2022</strong>. Then nothing happened until 2025! A mechanical inspection was cancelled in <strong>May 2025</strong>. The house passed the final building inspection on <strong>October 30, 2025</strong>.
                <ul>
                    <li>Why were there years in between inspections?</li>
                    <li>What happened to the final electrical and mechanical inspections?</li>
                    <li>The house was put on the market in June 2025 without completing the final inspection. It was only completed once the house was put under contract.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sewer Issues</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>There is a low point in the sewer/wastewaster drain line underneath the house that would require breaking up the cement slab in the basement to fix.</li>
            <li>There is root growth, debris, and possible damage to the sewer/wastewater line going from the house to the street.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Plumbing Issues</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>While some pipes were newer, some of the pipes are made of galvanized steel, and at least one pipe is corroded, restricting water flow.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Roof Issues</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Kickout flashing was improperly installed on the roof.</li>
            <li>There are telecommunications wires sitting directly on the roof as well as pulled tight against the house that were not hung properly from the pole.</li>
            <li>Downspout drains drop water directly onto the driveway/walkway.</li>
            <li>There was a lot of tree debris on the roof, which can cause improper drainage to gutters and downspouts. There was a lot of debris in the gutters, which lacked any type of guard.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Yard Issues</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The back yard slopes back toward the house, which could lead to water intrusion and foundation issues.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Garage Issues</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The garage foundation is shifting after only 5 years. Look for unevenness of the pads inside the garage and cracks around the edges near the walls.</li>
            <li>There are gaps in the garage wall near the door to the house where pests and moisture can enter.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Basement Issues</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The concrete slab is shifting and cracking at the floor structure. This can be caused by moisture intrusion and/or soil movement.</li>
            <li>There is cracking in the exterior walls.</li>
            <li>There are signs of water intrusion in the underlying floor structure. Look at the baseboards near the stairs. It appears to be an old problem, but it's unclear if it was properly resolved.</li>
            <li>There is no subfloor or vapor barrier underneath the vinyl floor. Also, the floor is very uneven.</li>
            <li>The bathroom has no fan. Hope you like cracking a window while showering when it's freezing cold outside!</li>
            <li>Many of the outlets are "open ground" and not properly connected to the home's grounding system. It looks like two-prong outlets were replaced with three-prong outlets but not properly installed.</li>
            <li>There are signs of water damage in the ceiling and floor joists above the washer and dryer.</li>
            <li>There is moisture damage in the corner of the living area along the white wall just above the baseboard near the wood wall.</li>
            <li>Remnants of what looks like it used to be a shower in the basement have pipes that are not properly closed off.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>HVAC</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Despite the HVAC system being somewhat new, the furnace and air ducts were dirty.</li>
            <li>There is an air leak next to the furnace where air is escaping.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Kitchen Issues</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Several outlets in the kitchen are not grounded.</li>
            <li>The kitchen cabinets have a shim underneath some of them because the floor is not even.</li>
            <li>The countertop needs to be re-caulked where it meets the walls.</li>
            <li>The middle burner on the stove is slow to ignite.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Other Issues</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Why is there a fireplace 4 feet up the wall?</li>
            <li>Bathrooms floors and countertops need to be re-caulked near walls.</li>
            <li>The door from the garage into the home has self-closing hinges that are not operating.</li>
            <li>The house listing indicated the solar panels would be paid off by closing. But that text has been in the listing for months and it is unclear if the solar panels were indeed paid off.</li>
        </ul>
